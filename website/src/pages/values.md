## Transparency

KubeHuddle is a community run conference and we want to ensure that everything we do and say is transparent and made publicly available.

- Our task list and what we're planning is all public on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/KubeHuddle/projects/1)
- [Our sponsorship details are all public](/2022/sponsorship)
- All titles submitted as potential sessions at KubeHuddle are public on [Sessionize](https://sessionize.com/KubeHuddle)
- This [website is open source](https://github.com/KubeHuddle/KubeHuddle)
- Currently KubeHuddle is being run through my (@rawkode) company, but after the first event we'll migrate this to a non-profit. All financial transactions for KubeHuddle will be made public as soon as I find a nice way to handle that.
