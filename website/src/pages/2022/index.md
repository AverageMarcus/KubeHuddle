### Track 1 - Introductions & Intermediate Presentations

This track will feature beginner friendly and intermediate content to cater for a wide variety of experiences, including beginers to Kubernetes

### Track 2 - Advanced Presentations

This track will feature advanced Kubernetes topics revolving around scale, multi-tenancy, and operations - you know, all that "fun" stuff.

### Collaboration Space

There will be tables provided for people that want to sit with their laptops and collaborate with others, perhaps hacking on a cool new operator? A small selection of workshops and tutorials will also be available throughout the two days, at no extra cost.

### Socials
